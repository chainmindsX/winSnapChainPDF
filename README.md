# 📸 WinSnapChainPDF

WinSnapChainPDF is a smart and lightweight Windows utility developed by [ChainMindsX](#about-chainmindsx) that **automatically captures screenshots whenever the Right Ctrl key is pressed**, and seamlessly **compiles them into a PDF** when the system shuts down or goes to sleep. 

This tool is ideal for professionals who want to log their desktop activity, developers who want to track what they were working on, or anyone who needs a hands-free, organized way to save session visuals.
